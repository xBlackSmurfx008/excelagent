- **OP Requirement**: Obtain month-end NCB statement and find ending balance
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLIANT**

### **Step 4: Month-End Balance Setup**
- **Agent**: `month_end_balance_setup.py`
- **OP Requirement**: Enter month-end balance for each GL in column O
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLIANT**

### **Step 5: Transaction Reconciliation**
