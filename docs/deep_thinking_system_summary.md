# Initialize orchestrator
orchestrator = MasterDeepThinkingOrchestrator(
    config={"log_level": "INFO", "max_execution_time": 3600},
    training_data_path="training_data"
)

# Execute comprehensive analysis
input_data = {
    "analysis_type": "comprehensive",
    "include_training_analysis": True,
    "include_ncb_analysis": True,
    "include_flex_analysis": True
}

result = orchestrator.execute_with_monitoring(input_data)
