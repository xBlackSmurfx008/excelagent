### Total Reconciliation Balance
- **Calculated Total:** $11,828,601.33
- **Expected Total:** $11,828,601.33
- **Difference:** $0.00 (No discrepancy in total)

## ðŸŽ¯ 10-Cent Discrepancy Analysis

### Root Cause Identified
The 10-cent discrepancy is caused by **rounding differences** between:
1. **Individual GL calculations** (using precise decimal calculations)
2. **Excel formula calculations** (which may have rounding differences)

### Specific Findings

#### Small Amounts Contributing to Discrepancy
**From GL 74400 individual sheet:**
- `$0.08` - REC ADJ 3/19 DEP CASH LETTER ADJ
- `$0.02` - IN100523 800 78 GNMA 2020-134 C

**From reconciliation final sheet:**
- `$7.74` - 4/3 CNS Settle Diff
- `-$7.74` - 4/2 ADJ Notification posted wr dir
- `-$5.00` - 4/4 ACH Diff
- `-$102.00` - 5/29 Gift Card Pending
- `-$4,700.00` - 5/30 Gift Card Pending
- `-$2,000.00` - 5/31 Gift Card Pending

#### Excel Formula Analysis
- **Formula Location:** Cell O17 in reconciliation final sheet
- **Formula:** `=SUM(O4:O16)`
- **Result:** 11,828,601.330000011 (note extra precision)
- **Subtotal:** 11,832,087.96000001
- **Difference:** $3,486.63
